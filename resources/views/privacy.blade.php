        <p>
            We protects your privacy in several ways that most web sites do not:
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption - This site and everything you do on it is encrypted using SSL and ECDHE_RSA, also known as "perfect forward secrecy."</li>
                <li>IP Address - Our log files do not record your IP address, so we have no idea who is visiting our site.</li>
                <li>Log retention - Our log files are only kept for one day and then purged.</li>
                <li>We do not collect any personal information from clients</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            We also recommend the following minimum configuration for improving your online privacy:
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Firefox Internet browser with the following extensions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ad Block Edge</li>
                        <li>Disconnect</li>
                        <li>HTTPS Everywhere</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a privacy-friendly search engine such as DuckDuckGo.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
